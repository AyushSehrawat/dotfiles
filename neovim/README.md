# Neovim Config

This config uses the Lazyvim (https://www.lazyvim.org/) as the base , and then customizes it as per use.

It also includes copilot and tailwindcss support. Also includes some custom key maps ( maybe more in future since i am not fan of pressing three keys to do some stuff )

## Requirements

I am using neovim 0.8.3 currently, so go for 0.8.0+ version only
Also you can install some plugins from Mason ( not mentioned in the config )
